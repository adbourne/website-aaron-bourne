A little while ago I designed and delivered a short workshop with the goal of introducing the [Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org/) to Developers from a Java background.

As far as programming languages go, Scala is in my top 5. The designers of Scala saw the value in the [Functional Programming (FP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) paradigm and looked to marry it with the [Object Orientated (OO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) paradigm from day one. This approach has only recently been adopted in Java 8 through the Streams API.

So if Java’s going functional, why learn Scala at all? There’s a lot of [advanced language features](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/) that Scala offers that Java does not. Scala is also completely interoperable with your Java projects. Not only that, but Scala is a nice entry point for some of the “purer” functional languages such as [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/).
